Orbital Traffic Center — Premium Version (Project Description)

Orbital Traffic Center-Premium Version is a comprehensive, real-time satellite visualization and autonomous space-traffic management simulator designed to explore the emerging challenges in navigating increasingly crowded Earth orbits. It ties together scientific modeling, interactive visualization, and adaptive AI behavior in one cohesive Python application. The result is a tool that is educational enough for students, flexible enough for researchers, and engaging enough for hobbyists fascinated by orbital mechanics.

At its core, the system maintains a fully dynamic 3D representation of Earth by wrapping a high-resolution texture map onto a rotating sphere. Satellites orbit this globe in real time using numerically propagated Keplerian elements. Each object leaves behind a configurable trail that shows recent motion, making it possible to intuitively understand eccentricity, inclination, resonance, and long-term orbital patterns. A complementary 2D plotting view shows ground tracks as they shift across Earth's surface, creating a layered spatial understanding of how satellites move relative to fixed geography.

One of the core objectives pursued in this work is the capability to simulate the process by which modern space-situational awareness systems detect the presence of a potential collision and how they respond to it. The code continuously analyzes the distances between all pairs of satellites, calculating both instantaneous separation and projected close approaches. When a potential conjunction is detected, the interface highlights the event, logs it, and-when configured-triggers spoken warnings to keep the user apprised of developing risks. Users can make manual avoidance maneuvers through the application of prograde, retrograde, radial, or normal thrust impulses, enabling hands-on experimentation with orbital changes.

The system also includes a lightweight reinforcement-learning agent, trained using the Q-learning approach, to add another level of autonomy. The agent observes relative geometry and hazard levels and chooses maneuver actions to reduce the likelihood of collision. Its policy is stored persistently so that learning accumulates between sessions. While intentionally simple, the agent serves to illustrate how adaptive decision-making can arise in space operations, and its logic is open to modification or extension.

The user interface is entirely designed in Tkinter, making controls accessible without depending on other tools. Clean modal dialogs enable adding, removing, and editing satellites. Status panels display orbital parameters, maneuver histories, warnings, and timestamps. The voice alerts, CSV export of maneuvers, adjustable visualization settings, and structured update loop ensure a comprehensive operational feel. Yet, despite the depth involved, this remains a single-script project, making it quite straightforward to study, adapt, and embed within teaching environments. In the end, Orbital Traffic Center — Premium Version provides an educational environment and, at the same time, a sandbox for the study of orbital mechanics and autonomous maneuvering. It visualizes real-life challenges such as congestion, conjunction prediction, and maneuver planning in an intuitive and visually understandable way. Whether applied to illustrate physics concepts, prototype AI behaviors, or simply to explore the dynamics of satellites in Earth orbit, the system offers a rich, adaptable platform for understanding some of the key complexities of modern spaceflight.
